# Python_Colored_Object_detection

OpenCV & Numpy based object detector using color spectrums.
<br />
Each color detected within the color spectrum of RGB will be closed in a bounding box and the coordinates of each object's center will be displayed relative to the top left corner (origin). The visiual input is taken from a smartphone through the app "DroidCam". 
<br />
Install the app on a smartphone and copy the given ip address and paste it in the " cap=cv2.VideoCapture('http://192.168.151.354:4747/video') " variable and replace the previous ip.
<br />
Connect to a single WiFi connection and then run the program. 
<br />
OR
<br />
Create a WiFi hotspot from your main device and connect your smartphone with it as this will give better results and no lags.
